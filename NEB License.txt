END-USER LICENSE AGREEMENT (EULA)

SUMMARY:
Feel free to use NEB however you want for personal or commercial projects. Please do not distribute or share it freely with unpaid users or sell it to others. No matter how much you change it, you cannot claim you made it yourself. NEB will keep receiving updates and lifetime support, which helps me create more tools for everyone.

⚠ Important: This is a non-refundable digital product. A free version is available for testing before purchase. Please make sure it meets your needs before buying.

IMPORTANT: PLEASE READ THIS AGREEMENT CAREFULLY BEFORE USING NEB.

   - Present modified or derivative works of NEB as their own original creation.
   - Remove, alter, or obscure any credits, watermarks, or notices included with NEB.

7. LICENSEE RIGHTS
   Licensee may:
   - Use and modify NEB for personal or commercial purposes, including creating commissioned works or monetized content using NEB.
   - Install and use NEB on multiple devices for personal use, provided this does not result in unauthorized distribution.

8. UPDATES AND SUPPORT
   - Licensor may provide updates, patches, and improvements to NEB at no additional cost to Licensees who have purchased it.
   - Licensor may offer support and assistance but is not obligated to do so.

   Compatibility Disclaimer:
   - NEB is provided as-is, without guarantee of compatibility with every system or software version.
   - Licensees are responsible for testing the free version before purchase to ensure it works with their environment.

9. REFUND POLICY
   NEB is a non-refundable digital product. By purchasing, you acknowledge that:
   - This is a digital file that cannot be “returned” once downloaded.
   - Under EU law, you normally have a 14-day right to cancel a digital purchase, but you lose this right if you agree to receive the product immediately.
   - By purchasing NEB, you agree to immediate access and waive your right to cancel or request a refund, even if you have not downloaded or used it.
   - A free version is provided so you can test the product before purchase. It is your responsibility to review the store page, tutorials, and documentation before buying.
   
   Note: Once purchased, I cannot issue refunds for software products due to the risk of refund abuse, as digital files cannot be “returned” once delivered.

10. TERMINATION
    This Agreement remains effective until terminated. Licensor may terminate this license if Licensee breaches any terms. Upon termination, Licensee must immediately cease unauthorized use and distribution of NEB.

11. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY
    NEB is provided "AS IS" without any warranty, either express or implied.

12. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
    Licensor shall not be liable for any incidental, indirect, special, or consequential damages arising from use or inability to use NEB.

13. GLOBAL APPLICABILITY
    This Agreement applies worldwide. By using NEB, Licensee agrees to abide by these terms regardless of geographic location.

14. COMMUNITY AND FAIR USE
    By using NEB, Licensee agrees to respect the license terms as a community trust that supports ongoing development. Unauthorized redistribution harms the community and the developer's ability to continue making free and paid tools.

15. PRE-USE RITUAL
    Before using this product, the Licensee is encouraged to:
    - Stand up and stretch your legs to avoid blood clots.
    - Choose a favorite mythical entity or spirit to pray to for a productive, stress-free day.
    - Take a sip of water to stay hydrated.

    Failure to perform these rituals may result in bad vibes and unforeseen software quirks. Proceed at your own risk.

    Note: This clause is purely for fun and is not legally binding. However, the rest of the Agreement definitely is — so please read it carefully!

Thank you for supporting indie development by using NEB responsibly and respecting this license.
